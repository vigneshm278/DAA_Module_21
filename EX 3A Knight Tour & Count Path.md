# EX 3A Knight Tour & Count Path
## DATE:
## AIM:
To write a python program to find minimum steps to reach to specific cell in minimum moves by knight


## Algorithm
1. Use Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from the knight’s position.
2. Enqueue the starting position with distance 0 and mark it as visited.
3. At each step, dequeue a cell and check if it is the target position.
4. If not, move the knight in all 8 possible moves and enqueue valid, unvisited cells with dist + 1.
5. Repeat until the target is reached, and return the number of steps (distance).

                visited[x][y] = True

    knightpos = [1, 1]
    targetpos = [30, 30]
    print(minStepToReachTarget(knightpos,
                               targetpos, N))
```

## Result:
The program executed successfully, and the minimum number of steps for the knight to reach the target was calculated.
